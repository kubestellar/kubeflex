# About this nextra subfolder structure

This folder (_kubeflex/nextra_) is the location for developing a newer set of website documentation for the KubeFlex repository.
It is intended to enable the new Nextra.js-based main KubeStellar documentation site to automatically ingest and include KubeFlex documentation from this repo, _as well as_ allowing KubeFlex to have its own independent site.

**All documentation files/folders for the new website(s) should be placed in the content subfolder of this folder**
